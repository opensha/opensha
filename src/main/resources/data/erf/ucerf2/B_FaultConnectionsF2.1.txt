# This file contains B fault connections. The line with "-" is the total connected fault's name. 
# Subsequent lines after that list the fault segments, where each segment is composed of one or more sections
# (separated by commas on that line).  Section IDs are used when reading this file, but names are also provided
# for convenience after the colon on each line.
# 
#  Examples:
# - Test Model
# 2, 7, 51:section1 name; section2 name; section3 name
# 3, 35, 1, 2:section4 name; section5 name; ...
# The above is an example of segment model whose name is "Test Model" and it has 2 segments. 
# Segment 1 has fault section Ids 2,7 and 15 
# Segment 2 has fault sections 3, 35, 1 and 2
# Note that for B-fault models there is no practical difference between segments and sections 
# (but we keep it here for format consistency with files for A faults)
