parameter file:,directrates-prvi-car-interface-v10-params.R
catalog file:,catalogs/pmmx_071725_c2-separatedAveraged_v2.csv-car-interface.RData
Time range:,1973,2024
Duration:,51
minmag:,5
maxmag:,NA
delta:,0.1
b:,0.97
minmagsigma:,0.2
magnitude thresholds are exact (not offset by one half of delta)
magnitude corrections (M*) are used
magnitude corrections (M*) are recomputed given b and minmagsigma
N* is used (and is taken from the catalog or recomputed the same as M*)
using probabilisitic classificcations
Recalculating corrected magnitudes and nstar with b=,0.97
not offseting magnitude thresholds
n quantiles,5
n magnitudes,31
Note: quantile 2 is the mean rate
The number of observations is the sum of N* for the earthquakes in a magnitude range
Nobs is the number of observations with corrected magnitudes at or above the given threshold
Nobsb is the number of observations with corrected magnitudes at or above the given threshold and below the next one
Rate per annum for each magnitude threshold and quantiles
First set of rates is cumulative and second set is binned
