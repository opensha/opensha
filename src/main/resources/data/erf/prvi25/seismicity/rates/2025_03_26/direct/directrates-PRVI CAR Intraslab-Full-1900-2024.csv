Recalculating corrected magnitudes and nstar with b=,0.97
not offseting magnitude thresholds
n quantiles,5
n magnitudes,8
Note: quantile 2 is the mean rate
The number of observations is the count of earthquakes in a magnitude range
Nobs is the number of observations with corrected magnitudes at or above the given threshold
Nobsb is the number of observations with corrected magnitudes at or above the given threshold and below the next one
Rate per annum for each magnitude threshold and quantiles
First set of rates is cumulative and second set is binned
