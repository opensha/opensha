/**
 * <b>Title:</b> CY_2006_AttenRel<p>
 *
 * <b>Description:</b> This implements the Attenuation Relationship
 * developed by Chiou & Youngs (2006).  Their documentation is available at
 * http://peer.berkeley.edu/lifelines/nga_docs/nov_13_06/Chiou_Youngs_NGA_2006.html <p>
 *
 * Supported Intensity-Measure Parameters:  BELOW NEEDS TO BE UPDATED<p>
 * <UL>
 * <LI>pgaParam - Peak Ground Acceleration
 * <LI>saParam - Response Spectral Acceleration
 * </UL><p>
 * Other Independent Parameters:<p>
 * <UL>
 * <LI>magParam - moment Magnitude
 * <LI>fltTypeParam - Style of faulting
 * <LI>rupTopDepthParam - depth to top of rupture
 * <LI>dipParam - rupture surface dip
 * <LI>rupWidthParam - down dip width of rupture
 * <LI>distanceRupParam - closest distance to surface projection of fault
 * <li>distRupMinusJB_OverRupParam - used as a proxy for hanging wall effect
 * <LI>vs30Param 
 * <LI>componentParam - Component of shaking
 * <LI>stdDevTypeParam - The type of standard deviation
 * </UL></p>
 *<p>
 * NOTES: distRupMinusJB_OverRupParam is used rather than distancJBParameter because the latter 
 * should not be held constant when distanceRupParameter is changed (e.g., in the 
 * AttenuationRelationshipApplet).
 * <p>
 * Verification :This model has been tested with the data provided by Chiou and Young in their NGA report Table 6.
 * I took values as provided in the file and created a text file where each line has following info:<br>
 * Period (sec) 	M 	RRUP	 VS30	 RJB 	Width (km) 	FRV	 FNM	 ZTOR 	DIP	SA1130 (g) 	SA (g) <br>
 * Each element of the line is seperated by space. I read this file and provide the input parameters in
 * OpenSHA with these values. Then I compare the OpenSHA result with that given by Chiou and Young NGA report.
 * I am using JUnit testing to validate the implementation of the Chiou and Young model. One can run the JUnit test
 * and compare the OpenSHA results with the Chiou and Young NGA model. If any of the result show discrepancy then
 * JUnit test will fail. When it fails it will also show for which input parameters the test failed.
 *
