# all lines that start with "#" are ignored (can be removed); 
# choices can be modified by uncommenting the "#";   
# the order of the other lines is important!
#
#
# First line defines which Earthquake Rupture Forecast (ERF) to use
# choose either "USGS/CGS 2002 Adj. Cal. ERF" or "WGCEP UCERF 1.0 (2005)"
USGS/CGS 2002 Adj. Cal. ERF
#
# Second line indicates whether to include BackGround sources (true or false)
true
# Third line defines rupture offset for flaoters 
# (between 1 and 100; 5 is generally best)
1.0
#
# Fourth line specifies number N of Attenuation Relations
4
# One the next N lines, identify the N attenuation 
# relationships from the following options:
# "AS_1997_AttenRel"
# "BJF_1997_AttenRel"
# "Campbell_1997_AttenRel"
# "CB_2003_AttenRel"
# "Field_2000_AttenRel"
# "SadighEtAl_1997_AttenRel"
# "SEA_1999_AttenRel"
# "ShakeMap_2003_AttenRel"
# Click links at bottom of following link for some details:

#
# Next, first choose the number of Intensity Measure Types to consider 
# in this calculation, and then specify those Intensity Measure Types.  
#
# Currently the following are supported: "PGA", "PGV", "SA", and "MMI".  
#
# If "SA" is chosen, then  give the period as well (e.g., "SA 1.0").
# The code will throw and exception (show an error message) if the chosen 
# intensity-measure type is not supported by the chosen attenuation 
# relationship (the html documentation given above lists those that are supported)
# 
# Number of IMTs for which computation needs to be done (has to be just 1 for the test case. If more then 1 it will average out the curves for wrong  IMT's)
1
# Identify those IMT's:
SA 0.2
# 
# Next, give the number of sites and then the lat, lon, and  
# Vs30 (m/sec) for each. If no Vs30 is given, then it will 
# default to the Vs30 given by a digitized version of the 
# Wills et al. (2000, BSSA, pages S187-S208). This latter
# feature requires internet access.
#
# Specify the number of sites(Just one, if more then 1 then curves will average out for wrong sites):
1
# Enter the Lat, Lon, and optionally Vs30 on a separate line for each:
# e.g., "34.1 -118.1 760"  
34.0852 -118.1421 760
