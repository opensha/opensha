# This is an example input file for IM_EventSetCal program.

# All lines that start with "#" here are comments and are ignored by the code (and can be removed if you want); 
# Choices below can be modified by uncommenting the "#";   
# The order of non-comment lines is important!
#
#
# First line defines which Earthquake Rupture Forecast (ERF) to use
# choose one of the following three choices (and remove quotes):
# "WGCEP (2007) UCERF2 - Single Branch"
# "USGS/CGS 2002 Adj. Cal. ERF"
# "WGCEP UCERF 1.0 (2005)"
# 
WGCEP (2007) UCERF2 - Single Branch
#
# Second line indicates how to handle background seismicity.  Options are "Include", "Exclude", and "Only Background".
Exclude
# Third line defines rupture offset for floating ruptures
# (between 1 and 100 km; 5 km is generally best)
5
#
# Fourth line specifies number N of Attenuation Relations
3
# One the next N lines, identify the N attenuation 
# relationships from the following options
# (first three are latest but not final NGAs):

# Next, first choose the number of Intensity Measure Types to consider 
# in this calculation, and then specify those Intensity Measure Types.  
#
# Currently the following are supported: "PGA", "PGV", "SA", and "MMI".  
#
# If "SA" is chosen, then  give the period as well (e.g., "SA 1.0").
# The code will throw and exception (show an error message) if the chosen 
# intensity-measure type is not supported by the chosen attenuation 
# relationship (the html documentation given above lists those that are supported)
# 
# Number of IMTs for which computation needs to be done
2
# Identify those IMT's:
PGA
SA 0.2
# 
# Next, give the number of sites and then the lat, lon, and  
# Vs30 (m/sec) for each. If no Vs30 is given, then it will 
# default to the Vs30 given by a digitized version of the 
# Wills et al. (2000, BSSA, pages S187-S208). This latter
# feature requires internet access.
#
# Specify the number of sites:
3
# Enter the Lat, Lon, and optionally Vs30 on a separate line for each:
# e.g., "34.1 -118.1 760"  
34.0543 -118.0821 270
33.6567 -117.7051 270
