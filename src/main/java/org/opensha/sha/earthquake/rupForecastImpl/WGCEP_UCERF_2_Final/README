The only differences between the contents of this 
folder and WGCEP_UCERF_2_3 are as follows:

1) Fault Models and Deformation Models are no longer read 
from the Oracle database, but rather from static XML files 
using the classes in the data/finalReferenceFaultParamDb 
folder here.  This way no Internet connections is required,
and the model won't change if someone does something to the
database.  Several checks were made, including using the
MeanUCERF2.testFinalMeanUCERF2() method.

2) The sources in MeanUCERF2 were put in alphabetical order 
(in the updataForecast() method).  Results were checked using 
the MeanUCERF2.testResortedSources() method.  However, it's 
possible that some of the analysis results are now screwed up 
(not everything was checked).
